# Ausk Web Application - Missing Features & Incomplete Implementation Analysis

## Executive Summary
This document provides a comprehensive analysis of missing features, incomplete implementations, and areas requiring attention in the Ausk web application.

## 1. Missing Page Routes

The sidebar navigation references several routes that don't exist:

### Missing Routes:
- `/app` - Chat page (sidebar points here but no route exists)
- `/app/data-room` - Data Room page
- `/app/logs` - Audit Logs page
- `/app/admin/members` - Members management page
- `/app/admin/settings` - Settings page

**Current State:** The dashboard at `/dashboard` exists but the `/app/*` routes are missing entirely.

## 2. API Endpoints - Mock Implementations

### `/api/files/route.ts`
- **Status:** Mock implementation only
- **Missing:**
  - Real database queries (currently returns hardcoded data)
  - Actual file storage integration (Supabase Storage or S3)
  - File upload validation and processing
  - File deletion implementation

### `/api/documents/process/route.ts`
- **Status:** Partial implementation
- **Missing:**
  - Legacy Office format support (.doc, .ppt)
  - PDF image extraction (returns empty array)
  - Proper error handling for unsupported formats
  - OCR integration for scanned documents

## 3. Data Room Features

### Fragment Management (`FragmentsTab.tsx`)
- **TODOs Found:**
  - Line 202-203: Fragment detail modal not implemented
  - Line 231-232: Navigation to source document not implemented
- **Missing:**
  - Fragment editing capabilities
  - Fragment search and filtering
  - Fragment version history

### Document Storage Infrastructure
- **Missing:**
  - Database schema for documents table
  - File storage configuration (Supabase Storage/S3)
  - Document indexing for search
  - Document sharing and permissions

## 4. External Service Integrations

### API Keys Required:
- OpenAI API (embeddings service uses dummy key)
- Perspective API (toxicity evaluator)
- Azure Content Safety API
- Resend API (email service configured but needs testing)

### Missing Configurations:
- Proper API key management system
- Key rotation mechanism
- Rate limiting for external APIs
- Fallback mechanisms when APIs are unavailable

## 5. Authentication & Authorization

### Issues Found:
- OAuth redirect URL hardcoded to localhost (partially fixed)
- Profile creation race condition during OAuth
- Missing RLS policies verification
- No organization/team management UI

### Missing Features:
- MFA implementation (flag exists but not implemented)
- Password reset flow completion
- Email verification resend functionality
- Session management UI

## 6. Database Schema Issues

### Missing Tables/Features:
- Documents table
- Document versions table
- Fragments table
- API keys secure storage
- Audit logs table (API exists but no storage)

### RLS Policies:
- Need verification of all table policies
- Missing policies for new tables
- Organization-based access control not fully implemented

## 7. UI/UX Incomplete Features

### Landing Page:
- Demo components use hardcoded data
- No actual backend integration for demos
- Interactive tutorial is placeholder content

### Dashboard:
- Only chat functionality implemented
- Missing data visualization
- No metrics dashboard (API exists but no UI)
- No notification system

### Missing UI Components:
- Document viewer
- Fragment detail modal
- File upload progress indicators
- Real-time collaboration features
- Search functionality

## 8. Development & Production Issues

### Console.log Statements:
- Found in 68 files
- Should be replaced with proper logging system
- May expose sensitive information

### Environment Variables:
- Missing production configurations
- API keys using development/dummy values
- No environment-specific settings

### Testing:
- No test files found
- Missing integration tests
- No E2E test setup

## 9. Feature Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed:
- Basic authentication flow
- Chat interface
- Landing page structure
- API route structure
- Supabase integration basics

### üöß Partially Implemented:
- Document processing (basic formats only)
- File upload (UI exists, backend mocked)
- OAuth authentication (needs fixes)
- Audit logging (no storage)
- Evaluators system (missing API keys)

### ‚ùå Not Implemented:
- Data Room functionality
- Document storage
- Fragment management
- Team/organization management
- Admin panel
- Settings management
- Real-time features
- Search functionality
- Metrics visualization

## 10. Security Concerns

### Issues:
- Dummy API keys in code
- No rate limiting implemented
- Missing input validation in some endpoints
- RLS policies need review
- No API authentication for some endpoints

## Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities:
1. Implement missing `/app/*` routes
2. Replace mock API implementations with real database queries
3. Set up document storage infrastructure
4. Configure external API keys properly
5. Fix OAuth profile creation race condition

### Short-term Goals:
1. Implement Data Room functionality
2. Add organization/team management
3. Complete fragment management features
4. Set up proper logging system
5. Add basic testing infrastructure

### Long-term Goals:
1. Implement real-time collaboration
2. Add advanced search functionality
3. Build admin dashboard
4. Implement MFA
5. Add comprehensive analytics

## Conclusion

The application has a solid foundation with well-structured code, but significant features are missing or only partially implemented. The priority should be on completing core functionality (document storage, data room, proper API implementations) before adding advanced features.
